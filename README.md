### Simple online shop

In this modest project I used:

- HTML
- styling with CSS
- simple JavaScript interactions 

This page cointains some info about the results of skill I recently picked up - making grade A kimchi for local sale. You can change colors, or make an order with click of a button, layout and pricing table is responsive on every type of smartphone.
